# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

Marked up a letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet ultilizing various aspects of hypertext markup language. There isn't anything that one needs to do to run the code as there is no code to run. Open the index.html file and click the open live preview or open in a web broswer to see the final product of the HTML.

I also found a small bug in the CSS.

This is the CSS code that I used to fix the sizing of the font issue I was having.
p,ul,ol,dl,address {
  font-size: 1.1; 
}

 The original code for this has an em following the 1.1 so...
 p,ul,ol,dl,address {
  font-size: 1.1em; 
}
By removing this I was able to get my addresses, tel, email, and date information to be the correct size.

## Sources and Credits

I utilized the webpages that you provided for the reading and otherwise, found that I was able to do most of the markup with my previous knowledge. I challenged myself to see if I could do most of the assignment on my own and found myself pleasantly surprised by the end of the project just how much I remembered how to do.
